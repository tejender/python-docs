# Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are basic data types in any programming language. These are

1. Integer
2. Float
3. complex
---   
## 1. Integer

The type of numeric data that is either `positive or negative whole number`, Falls under the category of integer.
The integer type is represented as '`int`'.

*Example :*
```python
age = 20
marks = 90
num = -30
```
---
## 2. Floating Point (Float)
Floating point type is also called float. These are the variables that holds `number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals`.

*Example :*
```python
height = 6.3
temprature = 40.3
```
---
## 3. Complex Numbers
A complex number is one that can be expressed inthe form of `a + bi`  and i satisfies the equation `i^2 =-1`.
Because no real number statisfies this equation , "i"
is called `imaginary number`. 

`In other words we can say, Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part`

*Example :*
```python
number = 5+ 3j
print(number)
```

**`Complex numbers are not ysed much in python programming unless we talk about scientific computing.`**
