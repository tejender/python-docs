# String Data Type 

A string is a ordered sequence of characters.They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same results. 

`\ can be used to escape quotes.`

Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. 

Lets see how we can define strings. Assume we want to store the first name and the last name of a person , then this is how we can do this.
```python
firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"
print(firstName)
print(lastName)
```
*Output :*

 `John`

 `Doe`

 ## Multiline Strings

 All the strings that we have defined till now are single line strings.

 Let's say we want to store multiple line strings, a quote or a paragraph for that matter.

 In python we can store multiline strings in a variable using triple quotes `(""".....""" or '''.....""")`

 *Example :*

 ```python
 mul_string="""This is a multi line 
 string. Pair of triple single or double quotes in used to create multiline string."""
 ```
 print(mul_string)

 *Output :*

 `This is a multi line`  
 `string. Pair of triple single`
 `or double quotes in used to `
 `create multiline string`

 `One thing to notice here in multiline strings is the way you format your strings in the triple quotes, it gets stored and printed in the same format`
